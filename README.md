To get started with this lab, you will need to download jQuery 2:
https://jquery.com/download/

The lab tasks were written against jQuery 2.1.4. You will need to
rename the downloaded jQuery js file to jQuery.min.js.

You will also need to download the jQuery tablesorter plugin:
http://tablesorter.com/docs/#Download

Unzip __jquery.tablesorter.zip and copy jquery.tablesorter.min.js
from the unzipped directory to the main directory. From either
the blue or green subdirectory under the themes subdirectory,
copy asc.png, bg.png, desc.png, and style.css to the main directory.

Once you are done getting jQuery dependencies set up, your directory
should have:

jquery.min.js
jquery.tablesorter.min.js
style.css
asc.png
bg.png
desc.png
task2.py
task2.tpl
task3.py
task3.tpl
task4.py
task4.tpl
...
